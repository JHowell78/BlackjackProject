## Blackjack Project

Week #4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp

### Overview

This projects purpose was to continue learning and using OOP concepts.  This was done by writing my code and building this program while trying to  follow the four principles of object-oriented programming. Which are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. I tried to keep as many parts of the games code with the corresponding class that actually would perform in real life. Such as having the dealer deal from his class and each players black jack hand mechanisms within their class as well.

### New Techniques Used

* Enum classes 
* Better use of java packages allowing re-usable deck of playing cards
* Try catch, for catching unexpected user input
* The Sleep method to slow the game down for readability

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Eclipse
* Git
* Atom
* Command line/terminal

### Plan of Attack

First I needed to think about the game of black jack and what classes would be needed to translate to their real life functions. I then set up the classes and each one had methods that mimic their real world "Jobs". I then created a loops that follow black jack rules for both the player and dealer. I then had to write similar methods that checked both hands for blackjack on initial deal and busts as the cards are dealt. Next I had to compare the hands and declare a winner. The last thing I did was create another loop, this time to ask the player if he wanted to play again or quit.
